# SoccerTracking_DL
Video segmentation of soccer matches project for Deep Learning DTU course.  

Since in this project all used code was launched from existing github repositories and most of the results were obtained in form of plots, videos or annotated images, the Jupyter notebook file does not contain procedure that was followed to get final results. Obtained videos and pictures can be found in this repository under folder __results__ and numerical results were discussed and presented in the report.
